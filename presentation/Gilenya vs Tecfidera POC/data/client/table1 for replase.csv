Notes:,,,,,,,
1. all these models' response variable is post relapse while persistent,,,,,,,
2. interaction between treatment and other covariates were included in logistic regression model,,,,,,,
3. uplift value equals to relapse rate of Tecfidera minus that of Gilenya,,,,,,,
4. modified outcome means label outcome as 1 if relapse and 0 if not for Gilenya; while code 0 if relapse and 1 if not for Tecfidera,,,,,,,
5. the above results are on the basis of test data (50% of full data),,,,,,,
