Notes:,,,,,,,
1. all these models' response variable is persistent,,,,,,,
2. interaction between treatment and other covariates were not included in logistic regression model,,,,,,,
3. uplift value equals to persistent rate of Gilenya minus that of Tecfidera,,,,,,,
4. modified outcome means label outcome as 1 if persistent and 0 if not for Gilenya; while code 0 if persistent and 1 if not for Tecfidera,,,,,,,
5. the above results are on the basis of test data (50% of full data),,,,,,,
